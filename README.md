## Description

The "gRPC Text Summarization Demo" is a project that demonstrates text summarization using gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call). It allows you to send a piece of text to a server, which then uses a pre-trained model to generate a concise summary of the input text.

This demo project serves as a starting point for text summarization applications and showcases the use of gRPC for efficient client-server communication.

## Features

- Summarize long text documents quickly and efficiently.
- Customize the maximum length of the summary.
- Uses the Hugging Face Transformers library for state-of-the-art summarization models.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Server

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grpc-text-summarization-demo.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd grpc-text-summarization-demo

3.Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Start the gRPC server:
python server.py


The server should now be running and listening on localhost:50051.

## Using the Client

Ensure the server is running.

Open the client.py script and replace the sample text with the text you want to summarize.

Run the client script:
python client.py

The client will connect to the server, send the text for summarization, and print the generated summary.

## Configuration

If you need to configure the project for specific settings or options, you can do so by modifying the server and client scripts.

## Usage

To use this project for text summarization, follow the instructions provided in the "Getting Started" section. You can also integrate the client and server components into your own applications.
